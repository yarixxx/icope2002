<h1>The regulation of Psychology curricula, teaching and assessment in UK Universities</h1>
<div class="author" style="float:left">Hammond, Nick<br />University of York,<br />UK</div>
<p>This paper will outline the wide range of mechanisms – both planned and fortuitous – which act to regulate Psychology curricula and teaching and assessment practices within the University sector in the UK. Whilst there are no nationally-defined curricula for Psychology programmes nor explicitly prescribed methods for teaching, learning and assessment, various mechanisms and drivers result in some conformance across institutions, and a degree of quality control and pressures for change. These influences include national funding bodies and agencies (such as the Quality Assurance Agency, which acts to ensure that standards of awards are safeguarded and enhanced), professional bodies (including the British Psychological Society, which accredits undergraduate and postgraduate programmes for professional recognition), individual institutions (which validate programmes, award degrees, and define their own strategies for teaching, learning and assessment), and departments (who define courses and define assessment methods and appoint external examiners). In addition, there are a number of external drivers including employers, student choice of courses and the wider social and political culture.</p>
<p>This complex set of influences results in positive and, on occasions, less productive pressures on educational practice. Examples of both of these will be presented in the paper. The presentation is intended to form the basis for discussions of regulatory structures and mechanisms in other countries and the influences these have on psychology education.</p>
