<h1>A Half-Century of Teaching Psychology: Retrospective and Perspective</h1>

<p>I began teaching psychology in 1946. Clearly many changes have occurred in the content, methods of teaching, and our understanding of teaching and learning in the years since 1946.</p>
<p>In content we have moved from behaviorism through cognitive psychology to motivation, emotion, and self-regulation.
Biopsychology has shown us that the brain works the way our psychological theories would predict.</p>
<p>In teaching we have moved from lectures to active learning and the tools available to us have moved through chalk and blackboard, film, paperback books and xeroxes, TV and videotape, teaching machines, and computers.</p>
<p>In our understanding we have moved from the teacher as a dispenser and reinforcer of learning to the view that what is important is what goes on in students' minds.</p>
<p>I shall review these trends as they are reflected in my own learning from my students, my research, and from interactions with psychologists in other institutions in this and other countries.</p>
