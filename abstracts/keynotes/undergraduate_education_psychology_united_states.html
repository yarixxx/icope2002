<h1>Undergraduate Education in Psychology: United States</h1>

</div>
<p>In the United States, educators have debated the undergraduate curriculum since the founding of Harvard College in 1636. This address will briefly trace the historical development of undergraduate psychology curricula in the United States. It will highlight several studies, including participants’ reports from conferences that examined the curriculum and recommended various structures for undergraduate programs. An unswerving commitment in all these reports and recommendations is that psychology should be taught as a rigorous scientific discipline within the liberal arts tradition. Sponsored by the American Psychological Association (APA) and held at St. Mary’s College of Maryland in 1991, the National Conference on Enhancing the Quality of Undergraduate Education in Psychology is the most recent such conference. The St. Mary’s Conference had the broadest representation of participants and the most comprehensive agenda than any previous one. Recommendations from this conference have influenced many changes in undergraduate programs. A few of these will be discussed in this talk (e.g., attention to human diversity, including cross-cultural foci; methodological competence; critical thinking; practical experience and application; communication skills, such as clarity, conciseness and felicity of expression; and ethical issues). Ongoing work of the APA’s Task Force on Undergraduate Education is an extension of work at the St. Mary’s Conference. Important aspects of this Task Force’s progress will be summarized to provide a picture of experts’ current thinking about undergraduate education in psychology. Increased recent attention to these and related matters may improve the quality of teaching and learning.</p>
