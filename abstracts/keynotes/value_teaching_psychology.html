<h1>The Value of Teaching Psychology</h1>

<p>The past twenty years has seen a massive expansion of psychology teaching, at many levels of education, and across the world. For many students, their psychology course is part of their general education rather than a precursor to further study, but this in itself is valuable. Psychology is a very special subject, with a unique ability to reach into everyday lives. Studying psychology offers students a unique set of educational opportunities, which go much further than just learning about interesting subject matter. But teaching psychology also involves the dissemination of psychological knowledge. A better public awareness of fundamental psychological concepts has benefits, not just for psychology teaching, but also for the psychological profession and for society as a whole.</p>
