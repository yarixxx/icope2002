<h1>Common Ways to Europe by Teaching of Psychology in International Courses: Report on German-Russian TOPEU-Project 1998-2000 and Results of Evaluation</h1>
<div class="author" style="float:left">Kittler, Udo<br />Dortmund University,<br />Germany</div>
<p><b>1.The idea of the project</b><br />
In the Nineties of the last century scientists from Rostow/Don (Russia), Amiens, Ioannina (Greece) and Dortmund decided to join the scientific development in Eastern Europe: The scientists mentioned above created and develloped a common project in Teaching of Psychology in Europe, and a bilateral application form succeeded in 1998 at the German Volkswagenstiftung: The financial support for this German-Russian summer school project came out of the program Common ways to Europe and the budget was 94 thousands Deutschmark:<br />
18 students from Rostov-on-Don (Russia) and Dortmund studied Psychology together and got a didactical training to teach psychology in Secondary Schools, Gymnasiums, Lycees and Comprehensive Schools.</p>
<p>We knew that different types of teaching methods in scientific courses would be a special challenge for both sides: Teachers and students in a similar manner. Cultural differencies could occur and could become big obstacles for common intercultural learning processes, including increasing prejudices. Our idea was to investigate by carrying out practical teaching courses in Russia and in Germany, whether the named obstacles could be reduced by common interactive learning.</p>
<p><b>2.The process of the TOPEU-Project</b><br />
Since March 1998 until March 1999 the coordinator and a work-unit with Russian and German scientists prepared the organization of two summer schools, two compact courses and examination event. We had to plan more than 180 hours of lectures, a bilingual reader for both student groups, the examination tests (multiple choice, bilingual), the topics of the scientific reports of the students (part of examination) and a cultural additional program. Furthermore we had to plan the design of evaluation, which will be the main part of my report. Interesting insights in common intercultural learning processes and their effects on indivuals and groups have been estimated.</p>
<p><b>3.Some general results</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Teaching of psychology in international courses motivates the participants both, students and teachers, more than so called „normal“ lectures (with well known usual teaching methods) in the respective homeland.</li>
    <li>Teaching of psychology under foreign language conditions leads to higher motivation for docents to develop themselves in using the main foreign language, which may be the international language of the specific science (in case of psychology: English)</li>
    <li>Teaching of psychology under foreign language conditions leads to more didactical effords on the side of the teachers (aspect of didactical reduction in responsibility to the science one represents)</li>
    <li>Students in international courses are encouraged to go up to mental, psychic and physical borders to reach a european international standard of knowledge finally</li>
    <li>Innovative effects of the TOPEU-project for reorganizing structures of teaching in universities are a matter of fact obviously</li>
</ul>
<p><b>4.Some special results</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The quality of teaching in comparison between the situation in summer schools and „at home“ was investigated: There is significant evidence that the quality of teaching in summer school gets a higher score than normal universitarian courses.</li>
    <li>The valuation of the whole project by the participating students differs between both groups: German and Russian students are equal in time t1, but differ in time t2: The Russian students judged the summer school higher than the Germans.</li>
    <li>The concept of selfvaluation of TOPEU-participants compared with „normal“ students „at home“: At both times (t1 and t2) the selfvaluation score of both student groups is significantly higher than for „normal“ students. Whereas the German students stay on their score level from t1 to t2, the Russian students valuate their selfconcept after the summer school higher than before.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>5.Conclusion</b><br />
Students of both groups (Russians and Germans) ascribe a high quality to the whole project – a reason to repeat!</p>
