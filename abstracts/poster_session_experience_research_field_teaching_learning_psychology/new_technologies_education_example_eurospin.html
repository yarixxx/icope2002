<p>Learning can be described as the procedure of acquiring understanding and using information. Cognitive psychology looks at the learning process through different points of view and studies the way people learn. Man is not a pathetic receiver of environmental stimuli, but has an active role. The need for supporting tools is obvious, not only in the first stage of the learning process (selection and collection of stimuli), but in promotion of students’ active participation as well. Technology is considered as a tool for engaged learning; sine in that case learning involves more student interaction, connections among schools, collaboration among teachers and students, and teachers acting as facilitators.</p>
<p>The topic of ODL (open distance learning) has become a very interesting subject of discussion in the past few years. We can describe the procedure of an ODL as the acquisition of educational or training information, including the instruction and experience, from learners physically distant from the source of that information.
We present as an example EUROSPIN (European Students’ Press Initiative). This implementation is through advanced Web enabled technology so as to familiarize students with the practical aspects of tele-working and European collaboration. The program makes use of the internet, both as a communication tool, and as an interactive Web based environment, which facilitates the access to the raw data of the research.</p>
<p>The EUROSPIN project aims at the development of a model of co-operation between the media and the schools throughout Europe. The project also aims at developing a model of active civic education that allows students to participate in research efforts. Within the program, students conduct a thorough research into the attitudes, political beliefs and ideological dispositions of European youth, under the supervision of experts. In contrast to most comparative studies, which are conducted by experts, EUROSPIN develops a model of active cooperation between students, teachers, experts and the press, giving thus emphasis on the pedagogical value of the activities. The results of this research are disseminated through printed (articles in the newspapers) and electronic media (interactive Web pages on the internet).</p>
