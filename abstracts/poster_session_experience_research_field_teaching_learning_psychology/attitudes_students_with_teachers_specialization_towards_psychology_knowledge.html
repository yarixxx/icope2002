<p>A special method has been elaborated to research the students’ attitudes towards Psychology knowledge. Its purpose is to investigate the cognitive representations of Psychology knowledge in students’ mind as a set of their attitudes towards Psychology knowledge. The students were instructed to evaluate the Psychology knowledge with a set of characteristics, which were offered by a researcher. All characteristics were designed as a set of 46 bipolar pairs. A 7 points’ scale was used, where point 1 meant the maximum of the attitude, described on the left side, and point 7 meant maximum of the attitude, described on the right side.</p>
<p>246 students of 3-5 years of study at the University were participants in this investigation. The mean, frequency, and dispersion of students’ scaling of each bipolar pair were scored and analyzed.</p>
<p>The results have shown that students with teachers’ specialization evaluate Psychology knowledge<br />
1) at the very high level as:<br />
perspective, necessary, actual;<br />
2) at the high level as:<br />
applied, interesting, up-to-date, systematic, persuasive, profound, credible, optimistic, flexible, intentionally acquired, learned with understanding, constructed as a whole, authoritative among the people, fundamental, well described, favorite, proved, generalized, realistic, humanitarian, rational, being aware;<br />
3) at the middle level (about point 4) or ambivalent ( with high dispersion) were evaluated such characteristics as:
universal, logical, accessible for understanding, politically orientated, empirical, not ordinary, well developed, learning-orientated, objective, steadfast, general, algorithmic, imagery, everyday originated, unique, having the only meaning, metaknowledge, laconic, academic, descriptive, national.</p>
<p>This method gives a possibility to investigate typical and individual features of students’ attitudes towards any particular field of Psychology.</p>
