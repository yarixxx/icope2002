<p>We want to present the data of a study done with students of Psychology
(N=164) and young psychologist (N=184) who already left the University of
Leipzig in Germany. At this University students reach graduation in
Psychology more quickly than in any other German University. The data
illustrate, how students and former students evaluate their education. For
those working as a psychologist meanwhile, we analyse, which aspects of their
education did help for a successful integration into the labor market. We
also look at determinants of success using indicators of subjective criteria
of success (reaching personal goals etc.).</p>
