<h1>Psychology in teacher training programmes in Germany: A crisis and a challenge</h1>
<div class="author" style="float:left">Langfeldt, Hans-Peter<br />University of Frankfurt,<br />Germany</div>
<p>Teacher training in Germany differs from that in other countries in various aspects. It is offered exclusively at universities, and students must opt to become teachers right at the beginning of their course. They then choose a combination of two teaching subjects (e.g. German and History or Maths and Physics) and commence the study of education at the same time, a compulsory part of which is psychology. This presentation will begin with a description of the structure of the German education and teacher training system, and will then move on discussing the challenges it poses on the study of psychology.</p>
