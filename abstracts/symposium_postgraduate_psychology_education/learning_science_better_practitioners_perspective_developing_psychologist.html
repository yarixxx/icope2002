<p>The post-graduate experience is the time for the scientific basis of applied psychology to be explored and emphasized. That is, it is imperative that the scientific findings of major figures be explored in depth, as well as the scientific method itself. The fundamental task to help practitioners use the scientific findings from such scholars. The case examples of B.F. Skinner, Ivan Pavlov, and Joseph Wolpe will be presented and discussed. It is my belief that only on the basis of scientific experimentation—as well as close attention to pertinent cultural variables—can we truly develop practical psychotherapy plans for the modification of maladaptive behavior and the remediation and poor educational performance. As a post-graduate student, experimenter, and Adjunct Professor, I think it is critical that the many roles available to practitioner psychologists emphasize the core importance of the scientific basis of psychology. Unfortunately, the degree to which this occurs is variable both within and between the high educational systems of different countries.</p>
